         <p><b>Abstract:</b> TBC </p>
         <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Bio:</b> Thomas Ploetz is a Computer Scientist with expertise and almost two decades of experience in Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning research (PhD from Bielefeld University, Germany). He works as a Professor of Computing at the School of Interactive Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, USA. His research agenda focuses on applied machine learning, that is developing systems and innovative sensor data analysis methods for real world applications. Primary application domain for his work is computational behavior analysis where he develops methods for automated and objective behavior assessments in naturalistic environments, thereby making opportunistic use of ubiquitous and wearable sensing methods. Main driving functions for his work are "in the wild" deployments and as such the development of systems and methods that have a real impact on people's lives.

          Thomas has been very active in the mobile and ubiquitous, including wearable computing community. He is co-editor in chief of the Proc. of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable, and Ubiquitous computing technology (IMWUT), has twice been co-chair of the technical program committee of the International Symposium on Wearable Computing (ISWC), and was general co-chair of the 2022 Int. Joint Conf. On Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp). Thomas is a Distinguished Member of the ACM. More info <a href="http://thomasploetz.de">here</a> </p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Neuroscience-based interaction </p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Recent trends in Ubiquitous Computing are making possible the use of innovative technologies and techniques from Neuroscience to uncover innovative interaction techniques that offer multiple benefits for the collection of data that is relevant to predict and manage health issues. In this talk, I will discuss current challenges and opportunities of Neuroscience-based Interaction in support of the treatment and screening of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. I will illustrate its potential through three research projects. The first project showcases how to trick your brain using interactive sonification to make Yoguis feel more flexible. The second project demonstrates that brain-computer video games are effective in supporting neurofeedback training and improving the attention of children with autism. And the third project shows how to uncover digital markers of autism by means of affecting children’s interactions with a haptic device. I will close by discussing research opportunities and the untapped potential of recent breakthroughs in Neuroscience for the development of innovative NUIs designed to support healthcare. </p>
        <p><b>Bio:</b> Monica Tentori is a full Professor in the Computer Science Department of CICESE where she leads the VeritasResearchLab. Her research interests in ubiquitous computing involve challenges related to AI, sensing and ML, and HCI. Her work has focused primarily on supporting challenges associated to health and urban environments. Her research intersects with ubiquitous computing and HCI. She is the first Latin American woman and the only Mexican who have received the international award “Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship”. She is the first woman from Ensenada who received the award of distinguished citizen of the city of Ensenada for her work in technological innovation. She is member of the National System of Researchers (SNI) as level II.
